    "Demonstration and test of a more general seepage condition in which an infiltration flux is specified on the seepage face.  The condition has constraints on both sides -- infiltration is less than or equal to the specified flux, and the pressure is less than atmospheric.  This is useful for, for instance, spinning up coupled surface-subsurface runs.  The subsurface only is run, with this type of BC everywhere and the infiltration as the mean annual rainfall rate.  Everywhere there are rivers end up with atmospheric pressure, while everywhere there is not ponded water sees the infiltration condition (at steady-state).\n",

The seepage face infiltrates until the entire column is saturated, at which point the seepage face sets the max pressure as p_atm.  Then, after 1/2 year, the bottom boundary condition is set to drain the column at twice the rain rate.  This draws down the water table below the surface, and the rain infiltration is again active.  At 3/4 years, the drainage condition is set to equal the rainfall rate, ensuring that steady state is reached and the water table stays below the surface.\n"
