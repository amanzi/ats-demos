test0:
 - basic, constant forcing
 - no veg, no snow
 - unsaturated
 - condensing at ss

test1:
 - basic, constant forcing
 - no veg, no snow
 - unsaturated
 - evaporating at ss

test2:
 - basic, constant forcing
 - no veg, no snow
 - saturated
 - evaporating

Note this is a known limitation of CLM -- it cannot handle dynamic
wetting/drying, so albedo is always set by the soil value, even when
that soil is covered by water.  It might be possible to hack CLM to
deal with this case using itypwat, but it isn't dealt with now.

test3:
 test0, adds precip
 


Things to check:
- both sides of the evap sign (change rel hum)


- VEG TYPE: bare soil / forest / water body
- saturated state (1m belowground, aboveground)
- snow / nosnow

- MET DATA: constant, variable daily, variable hourly
